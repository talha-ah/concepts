1. [Javascript Algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/blob/master/src/data-structures/linked-list/LinkedList.js)
   This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.
   Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).

2. [WTFjs](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs)
   JavaScript is a great language. It has a simple syntax, large ecosystem and, what is most important, a great community. At the same time, we all know that JavaScript is quite a funny language with tricky parts. Some of them can quickly turn our everyday job into hell, and some of them can make us laugh out loud.

3. [Clean code](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)
   Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of Clean Code.

4. [Javascript Questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)
   From basic to advanced: test how well you know JavaScript, refresh your knowledge a bit, or prepare for your coding interview! üí™ üöÄ I update this repo regularly with new questions. I added the answers in the collapsed sections below the questions, simply click on them to expand it. It's just for fun, good luck! ‚ù§Ô∏è
