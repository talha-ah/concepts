# 1 - Why Iterative method over recursive approach

# Recursion uses stack memory to store the nodes to be processed. (for each recursive call, the stack is increased by one)
# Because stack space in the memory is limited as stack is used for recursion (may also be slow)
# While
# Iteration uses heap memory which depends on the space you have installed in your cpu
# Iterative functions are scalable & distributeable

# 2 - User OOP

# Because classes provide instance variables maintains state across multiple functions in a class
# instance variables are acceptable over global variables in functions
